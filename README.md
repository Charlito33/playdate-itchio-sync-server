# playdate-itchio-sync

Keep your Playdate sideload games synced with your itch.io playdate game library.

The goal of this repo is to make playdate-itchio-sync a Express NodeJS app.

## Requirements
- node.js 16+

## Notes
- Will not work with accounts that use two-factor authentication on itch.io.
- You *must* set a password for your itch.io account, oAuth is not supported.
- Only works with games you have __paid for__ currently.
- You will probably want to run this every once in a while, it's not a background process.
- Use at your own risk!
